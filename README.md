## Hello! Welcome to my GitHub.

**I am a newbie NLP engineer just starting to learn how things work.** But I still do love physics and many other things.

**I am currently working as an intern NLP Engineer at [TUNiB](https://github.com/tunib-ai)** developing St. Patrick, the hate speech detection engine. Check out the demo version on this [link!](https://demo.tunib.ai/safety)

**I am an undergraduate student at Cornell University,** double majoring in Physics and Information Science (Data science concentration).

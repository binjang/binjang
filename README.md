### Welcome to my Profile!

Hi, I’m Bin Jang, a Machine Learning Infrastructure Engineer at  [Moloco](https://www.moloco.com/), based in the San Francisco Bay Area.

I work on making thousands of training jobs at Moloco more scalable, cost-efficient, and faster. I also believe code only matters when people can understand and use it, so I value readability, simplicity, and focused design.
